Functions and an Introduction to Recursion
==========================================

# Introduction

-- track of which functions is currently executing

-- program performance: inline functions that can eliminate 
the overhead of a function call and reference parameters

-- function overloading: function of the same name

-- function templates: a mechanism for defining a family of overloaded functions

# Program components in C++

-- C++ Standard Library: mathematical calculations, string manipulations, character
manipulations, input/output, error checking

-- Functions allow you to modularize a program by separating its tasks into 
self-contained units.

-- user defined functions, programmer defined functions

-- divid-and-conquer approach, software reuse, avoid repeating code

SOFTWARE ENGINEERING OBSERVATION: To promote software reusability, 
every function should be limited to performing a single, well-defined 
task, and the name of the function should express that task effectivelly.

-- function is invoked by a function call

-- hiding of implementation details

-- main: global function
